Requires at least: 2.8
Tested up to: 2.8
Stable tag: 1.0.0

This plugin lets you set your own values for the link relations 'next'
and 'prev' which appear in the head part of your posts.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

I'll put some here after some have been asked.

== Screenshots ==

None really needed unless you really want a little picture of the
sidebar box of the edit form.

== Description ==

By default, WordPress 2.8 puts link relation tags in the header of
your posts, with the next and prev relation links pointing to the next
and previous posts, chronologically.  Sometimes, this is not what you
want, which is where this plugin comes in.

A new sidebar meta box is added to the post edit form, which lets you
set the title and URL for the next and/or prev link relations.

Or you can just leave them blank for the defaults WordPress behavior.

== Installation ==

Unzip it and activate it and the meta box will be available.

== Further Instructions ==

Any other information I have can be found at the [Custom Rel Homepage](http://www.hostscope.com/wordpress-plugins/custom-rel-plugin/).

== License ==

I dunno.  How about creative commons attribution?  Sound ok?  Good.
